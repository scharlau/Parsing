# README for Parsing

This is a 'Deliberate Practice' exercise focusing on different ways to use Ruby to pull data from files and to dump it into your database as part of a Rails application. This application uses helper classes in Ruby for this, such as CSV class, and the JSON class, and as well as the fall-back of String methods with the File class.

We'll use this data on Polar bears in Alaska to develop our application
Data taken from https://alaska.usgs.gov/products/data.php?dataid=130 Download the zip file and unpack it to a folder.

## Setting up the exercise

With this we can start developing our application.

    rails new parsing

This will create our new app structure. We can now look at the csv file and create some scaffolding to model and manipulate the data with the command

    bin/rails generate scaffold deployments BearID:integer PTT_ID:integer capture_lat:decimal capture_long:decimal Sex Age_class Ear_applied

We could use all of the data, but as we're not biologists, we'll only take what looks interesting to us. This is why we only grab some of the columns of data from the file. If we change our minds, then we write a migration to modify the database, and then edit the view and controllers files accordingly to make the changes. It's a bit of work, but easier than seeking to remove the scaffolding, and starting over.

We need to run the migration to set up the database.

    rails db:migrate

## Do the Work ##

Work through the three rounds with a partner, or on your own, depending upon your circumstances. Each round should be twelve minutes, followed by a discussion of where you are and what has been working, as well as, what you're working on next.

Now we need to get the polar bear data into our app. We have a number of options with which to do this. We'll start with the CVS class as our data is in this format.

1. Round one should be reading the csv file and getting the data into the application.
2. Round two should be displaying the data in a suitable manner.
3. Round three should be adding in the 'status.cvs' file to tie together the bears with their current status.

## Reading a CSV file
This is a common approach to working with open data, which is available in this format. There are methods available to read each row, and to parse them into objects for your application using http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.2/libdoc/csv/rdoc/CSV.html You can also find more at https://www.sitepoint.com/guide-ruby-csv-library-part/ and you can also explore CVSReader gem https://github.com/csv11/csvreader which works better too. Look at the reasons for issues around the standard library at https://github.com/csv11/docs/blob/master/why-the-csv-stdlib-is-broken.md 

We can start with generating a seed file to move the data. We do that with the command

    rails g task bears seed_bears

This will create a file under lib/tasks/bears.rake which we can now modify to suit our needs.

Now, go look at lib/tasks/bears.rake in the repo, and copy the code to your file. Run it with the command

    rake bears:seed_bears

Then start rails, and go look at http://localhost:3000/deployments to see your list of bears.

## Following individual bears on their own page
You could expand on this by parsing the ...status.csv file so that it uses the DeployID column to reference the BearID column in our original file. This will let us see where each bear goes. Then you could use the geo-location data to plot their locations on a map.

Do this by coping lines 4-23 (the task seed_bears method) and pasting this into line 24 and giving it a new method name such as seed_status, and then changing the items you retrieve from each row in the file.

## The data is messy and the parsing will break
When you run this new method you will find the parsing breaks due to gaps in the data. It broke because one of the cells had no data, or had the data format different from what the parser was expecting. Given we're only doing this as an exercise, you can find the broken cell you can either
a) delete the row, and then re-run the rake command, or
b) write a few lines of code as an 'if/else' statement to check the value of the cell and to either ignore it, or do something else as required to make it work.
For simplicity here, just delete the row and move on so that you get the file imported and the page views showing. You can see the start of this work if you switch to the 'solution' branch and look at the rake file there.

Then, you can go back to the views/deployments/show.index.html.erb file and bring in the relavant data from the status table to display here. Ideally, you could even plot the bear locations with a map.

##  TODO Reading a JSON file
Ruby works well with JSON, as does Rails so using the JSON class is easy. http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.2/libdoc/json/rdoc/JSON.html

## TODO Reading a Text File
This approach uses the File class to open a regular text file and reads each line looking for the different components, which will make up the data in the application. http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.2/File.html
